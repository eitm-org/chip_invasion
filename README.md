# Chip Invasion and Contour Analysis (ChICA) - A thin plate spline-based tissue modelling and tumor cell object quantification method

R Shiny app to quantify tumor cell invasion in organ-on-chip models

R code and data to replicate the figures and analyses in Elizabeth Elton, Carly Strelez, Nolan Ung, Rachel Perez, Kimya Ghaffarian, Naim Matasci, Shannon M.
