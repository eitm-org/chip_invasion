# Chip Invasion and Contour Analysis (ChICA) - A thin plate spline-based tissue modelling and tumor cell object quantification method

R Shiny app to quantify tumor cell invasion in organ-on-chip models

R code and data to replicate the figures and analyses in Elizabeth Elton, Carly Strelez, Nolan Ung, Rachel Perez, Kimya Ghaffarian, Danielle Hixon, Naim Matasci, Shannon M. Mumenthaler (2024) A novel thin plate spline methodology to model tissue surfaces and quantify tumor cell invasion in organ-on-chip models SLAS Discovery [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.slasd.2024.100163](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.slasd.2024.100163).

This repository contains the R Markdown used to generate figures for the paper. The folder 'figure_data' contains consolidated OOC measurements. Functions for analysis and plotting are in 'chip_invasion/functions.R' sourced in the main Rmd.
